# neural-network-scratch
A neural network implementation from scratch for CPU and GPU (in theano)


#### Tasks
- [x] Add preprocessing script of MNIST dataset 
- [x] Add CPU implementation (based on [book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen)
- [x] Add theano implementation
- [ ] Add tests on MNIST dataset
- [ ] Add the graphs used for choosing the final parameters
> A small MNIST training data is also added for testing the implementation
